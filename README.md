I've split the task into 2 folders, Task 1 and Task 2.

In Task 1, you see a feature file with a small introduction on my way of thinking it and the test cases, written in Gherkin.
In Task 2, you see a collection.json file, as requested, with my Postman collection. The collection also has a structure of files
for the requests and a description explaining the scope and what was addressed.
